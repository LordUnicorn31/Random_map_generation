### Random map generation

## Introduction

In this webpage you will find all the information about the random generation of maps in video games.

## Procedural generation

In computing, procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Depending on the implementation, advantages of procedural generation can include smaller file sizes, larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay. Procedural generation is a branch of media synthesis.

# Applications of procedural generation

-Terrain/level creation

-Enemies/spawning

-Loot/weapons/gear

-Models/textures/animations

-Sound/music

-Story/quests/dialog




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LordUnicorn31/Random_map_generation/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LordUnicorn31/Random_map_generation/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
